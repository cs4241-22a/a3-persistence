github:
link:

middleware used:
lazydebug, a middleware function I wrote that console logs whereever you call it

expressRouter, for more routing options
ejs view engine for some server side rendering

CSS Template: Bootstrap

Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include:

- the goal of the application
- challenges you faced in realizing the application
- what authentication strategy you chose to use and why (choosing one because it seemed the easiest to implement is perfectly acceptable)
- what CSS framework you used and why
  - include any modifications to the CSS framework you made via custom CSS you authored
- the five Express middleware packages you used and a short (one sentence) summary of what each one does. If you use a custom function for _one_ (and one alone) middleware please
  add a little more detail about what it does.

## Technical Achievements

- **Hosting on Heroku**: If you can get to the site from the url, it works
- **100% Lighthouse Test**: All pages score 100% on google lighthouse in the 4 categories

### Design/Evaluation Achievements

- **Design Achievement 1**:
  CRAP Principles:
  contrast - light background with dark and legible text, bright buttons
  repetition - forms are as similar as possible, with predictable placement of inputs and buttons.
  Alignment - did center placement for most items, left aligned the create todo form because it was a bit bigger
  Proximity - Form elements were closer to each other than to other elements, made sure elements had space (margin, padding) and weren't crowded, and were grouped when they belonged together
