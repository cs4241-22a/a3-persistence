## The Homework Reminder

This project shows a webpage using HTML, CSS, JSON, and JavaScript (Node.js) to present a Homework Reminder
for students to markdown their assignments. I was able to design a single main page with a working form and generated
table when you hit submit. I had also conducted think-alouds with two students from WPI to test the Homework Reminder.
