To add information, go to the form below and type the details to add a class and the scores and click on "Submit"
To delete, you can just click in the "X" button corresponding to the row you want to delete
To edit, click on the "O" button corresponsing to the row you want to edit and the data would appear back on the form.You can edit whatever specific data you want and click on the "Submit the edited changes" button.


- challenges you faced in realizing the application: I really faced a lot of challenges while implementing the git auth. I also faced difficulties with mongo as I have never worked with it 
   
- what authentication strategy you chose to use and why: I chose git auth as it is something that our grader can access and also it seemed easier to implement. 

- what CSS framework you used and why: For the CSS, I used pure template and CSS because they seemed simple which is perfect for my simple app. I have also changed up the colors in the   css files such that I like them
  
- the five Express middleware packages you used and a short (one sentence) summary of what each one does. If you use a custom function for *one* (and one alone) middleware please : For the middleware
first one was passport, which helps me to handle the git oauth. Second one was response-time which records the response time for requests in HTTP servers so that I'm able check it. Thirdly, i used cookie-parser which parses cookies attached to the client request object and helps keep track of cookies in the server. Lastly, I used cookieSession to encrypt and manage the cookies
  
Persistent data storage in between server sessions I used [mongodb]

*Design/UX*
- (5 points) Describe how your site uses the CRAP principles in the Non-Designer's Design Book readings.  

For the login page, I made sure I have contrast on different elements such that it's easier to read stuff. Every color on this page are contrasting. I made sure that my app name is highlighted by coloring it black and putting it in a black box.I have also used opposite color white for the login button so that it is easily visible. I just put them in the order such that people can read it one by one and it easier to understand. I put just enough space between the elements such that they are nicely visible without being cramped. I used the similar fonts for all the text as I'm already differentiating with color and contrast. If I change the font too, to be different it would be too confusing and unorganized. They are all center aligned to make them seem coordinated. As it might be too boring to have a single background color, I just added a pane on the bottom to break it up

For the grader page, I used similar colors that I used in the login page to make it seem like a continuation of the previous page. These colors, similar to the login page, are contrasting enough for easier viewing. I center Aligned the title to make sure the people know that this page is the main page of the grader application. When I read the text about the CRAP principles, the author emphasized that not everything has to be center aligned. I had the paragraph area center aligned at first but I changed it to the left aligned and it looked much better. For the form and the table I made sure to use the same colors so that they seem related and this is where I used the repititiveness and putting them together organizes the website better. I made sure the text fields are different color so that easier to notice. I also put the logout right below the heading so that they can easily find it.
