Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include:

- the goal of the application: be able to store dates
- I got covid and don't know what's happening anymore and just need this project to go away. This submission is bad, and I am somewhat sorry
- what authentication strategy you chose to use - :shrug: none. The button simply takes you to the next page. Goal was to get the db to work. That failed.
- I used the picnic css framework because it seemed nice and simple, can do some neat stuff with buttons from the html
