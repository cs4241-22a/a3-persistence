- the goal of the application
- I found it difficult to build the table with http requests
- I chose passport.js because it is powerful and secure
- I used sakura, which is a simple yet powerful css template that has the same eastern mystic vibe
- I used urlencoded and json to parse the request into json/string/array, session to keep user loged in during a session, passport to varify the log in status, and checkLogIn, a middleware defined by myself to see if the user has logged in and decide which page to redirect to

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I used OAuth authentication via passport and the local strategy
- **Tech Achievement 2**: I used Digital Ocean as an alternative way of hosting the server


### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: I followed the following tips from the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative
1. I added titles for each of the html pages 
2. I used multiple layers of title to indicate split of sections
3. I used meaningful text on buttons and links to give a clear guidance
4. For the log-in page, I give specific error message to let the user know what inputs are wrong
5. I kept most contents in lists and tables, which is direct and easy to recognize
6. The css I chose has foreground and background with great contrast, which is easy to read
7. I used red only in warning and error message, which is conventional in websites
8. The button has hovering effect
9. I have clear lables for the form
10. The webpage fits both phone and computer
11. I have lables for every form element
12. I identified language in the header
