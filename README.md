My wesbite hase you log in/create accountso that you can comment on the raccoon memes on the main webpage. You can see other comments by different users.

Challenges included created a database that saved forever and didn't lose any of the information. I has a hard time saving and retreiving login data, but eventually got it working.

I used local authentication with cookies. Similarly with the CSS framework, milligram, because it looked nice and clean.

The five express middlewares I am using:

body-parser: for parsing incoming JSON data
passport: for authentication by username and password
express-session: for continuous authentication using cookies over the course of a single session
serve-favicon: for sending over the favicon.ico early in the app.use chain for extra performance
timeout: to ensure all incoming messages are handled properly if they time out
Technical Achievements
Refresh new chats: The client will check with the server for new chat messages as they arrive for a smoother chat experience! No need to constantly refresh the page.
Use of UUIDs to generate buttons - Used a npm package to randomly assign every message a UUID to determine which message to edit or delete
Instead of Glitch host your site on a different service: Heroku - I hosted my site on Heroku. It was harder than glitch to use launch a website. On Heroku, there was a longer learning curve to figure out how to use a website. I liked how the apps I make on Glithch are instantly live, hosted by Glitch, and always up to date/autosaving my latest changes. I found it interesting how Heroku is a cloud application platform. Overall I prefer Glitch.
Lighthouse tests - Gota 100% in all four lighthouse tests
Design/Evaluation Achievements
Best Practices: I followed best practices for accessibility, including providing alt attributes for images and using semantic HTML.
Number of users: I tested the application with a few different users. The social media website updates and stores their text inputs.
Describe how your site uses the CRAP principles in the Non-Designer's Design Book readings.: Contrast: I used contrast to mute less important elements. I provided contrast to the sizes of elements on my screen, such as the text boxes and button sizes. Contrast is also applied to the colors used for the website, the fonts, and the thickness of the lines. Contract also aided in my website's ability to space my elements (the headers, the table, the chatbox, the slideshow) and create the shapes of the elements on the website (like the textboxes). The titles, body text, bold text, and underlining help to organize the information on my website. Contrast makes my website meaningful and memorable and provides direction or instruction for the users. The difference in shape makes the bolded or italicized text stand out from the surrounding text.
Repetition: I repeated visual elements of their design throughout the site. Elements such as color, shape, texture, spatial relationships, line thicknesses, sizes, were repeated to help develop a sense of organization, unity, and consistency within my website. By repeating design elements on the screen such as titles, layout, color schemes and so on, I provided visual cues to the user so that they’re able to follow the website content and understand how it all fits together. Using reputation made it easier to design my website and eliminated the large learning curve it took to figure out how to use the website. I was also able to make a theme for the website using repetition. Next project I can just implement my theme instead of starting my app design from scratch. It helps me standardize the elements and flow of my webpage.

Alignment: Nothing on my website is placed on screen in an arbitrary way. Every element should have some visual connection with another element. This creates a clean, clear and sophisticated look and feel. Aligning my screen elements creates a visual flow and visually connects the screen. It helps the reader understand the purpose of certain elements of my website. For example, if I used vertical alignment for the text on my website, the users may not understand what the text is saying. They may not even try reading it, resulting in a loss of maybe important information. Poor alignment takes away from the user’s experience of the website, It also makes it so much harder to use and understand. Every element should be aligned properly, otherwise there is no point to alignment at all.

Proximity: Proximity on the screen provides a critical cue about whether items are or are not related. Elements that are related need to be grouped close together. When several elements are in close proximity to each other, they become one visual unit rather than several separate units. This helped me organize information, reduce clutter, and gave my user visual clues to help them understand the meaning of what’s being conveyed. I asked myself constantly while making my website: Can you find everything you need on your page easily? What is it that your learners will take note of? On my website the login text boxes and buttons are grouped together (as they are closer to each other) and the sign up textboxes and buttons are grouped together. That way there is no confusion on what any of these elements does.
