## Restaurant Log

I created an application with the goal of storing a user's ratings for different restaurants. I had a lot of trouble with the writing and editing of data in the user's dataset. I Chose the normal password login as it seemed to be more simple. I Used water.css as it seemed very simple and lightweight as I did not want a very cluttered looking page. I used body-parser to make it easier to parse information that is traveling to and from the database. I used cookie-session to keep data stored in cookies to use during the user's accessing of the site. I used express handlbars to help with using objects in the site with the req keyword. I used helmet to secure the page. Lastly, I used express-sslify to further secure the page.
