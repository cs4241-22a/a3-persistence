## Purchase List

https://files.craftsteamg.com:3000/
Simple purchase list, add items with cost, quantity, and payment method. 

Issue: Lighthouse says form does not have a label, but that is not under my control. It is an issue with the CSS framework. 

Authentication Strategy: GitHub OAuth
CSS Framework: Materialize
- I used this because it was simple, and looked clean
- Had to overwrite label colors as they did not have enough contrast.

Express Middleware
- passport used for OAuth
- express-session for session management
- connect-ensure-login to make sure user is logged in
- body-parser to easily access request bodies
- express.static to display error page
- cookie-parser to easily access cookies



## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I used OAuth authentication via the GitHub strategy
- **Tech Achievement 2**: I hosted my website on a Virtual Private Server. I liked this a lot more than glitch. I was able to use vscode to ssh into the vps and code directly to the server. I used tmux as a way to maintain the node program running. I implemented SSL as well.
