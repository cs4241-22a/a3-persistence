Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include:

**Goal** To create a to-do list that makes use of a server using Express, a results functionality for a logged in user, a form/entry functionality with options to add, modify, and delete, and data storage using mongodb.

- challenges you faced in realizing the application
- what authentication strategy you chose to use and why (choosing one because it seemed the easiest to implement is perfectly acceptable)
- I used the Pico template at <https://picocss.com/>. I thought it had a good use of colors and kept the design very sleek.
  - include any modifications to the CSS framework you made via custom CSS you authored
- the five Express middleware packages you used and a short (one sentence) summary of what each one does. If you use a custom function for *one* (and one alone) middleware please
add a little more detail about what it does.
