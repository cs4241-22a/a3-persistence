## Your Web Application Title

https://webware-a3-jrkim.herokuapp.com/

Small todo app with github login feature (OAuth 2.0) where it stores tasks so it saves todo tasks to each user.
I chose OAuth 2.0 for authentication since github used it and there were many established documents and example for it.
For CSS: ___.
- what CSS framework you used and why
  - include any modifications to the CSS framework you made via custom CSS you authored
For middleware
- cookie-parser: secret a string or array used for signing cookies
- path: define path and modify
- http-errors: error handling
- passport: sign-in options
- morgan: logging HTTP request and errors


## Technical Achievements
- **Authentication**: I used OAuth authentication to be able to login
- **Entry function**: A form entry function to add and pull data 
- **Server**: Server to store user and todo task data
- **Tech Achievement 4**: Middleware includes cookie-parser, path, http-errors, passport, and morgan

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
**Design Achievement 1**: I followed the following tips from the W3C 
- Include clear lable for each items such as task, date, description.
- Ensure sufficient contrast between elements and background by using lavender, white, black
- Wide testing pool to see if wide verity of users can use the website without external instruction
