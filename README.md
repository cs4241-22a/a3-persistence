Grocery List Maker
=

Decsription: This app allows a user to login to a grocery list. Items can be added, edited, and removed from the list. To login, the server checks if the credentials exist in a different MongoDB database from where the groceries are located. This was the easiest method for me.

Styles: I used the MUI framework for styling because I have used MUI a little bit in the past. I also added margins to the page since the MUI framework did not include it.

Middleware:
Cookies are used, as well as another middleware to confirm the user's account exists or was created by checking the db.
Another middleware that the db collection was found. 

The Edit button does not work for some reason. It fails
