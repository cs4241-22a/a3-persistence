Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include:

**Goal** To create a to-do list that makes use of a server using Express, a results functionality for a logged in user, a form/entry functionality with options to add, modify, and delete, and data storage using mongodb.

- challenges you faced in realizing the application
- what authentication strategy you chose to use and why (choosing one because it seemed the easiest to implement is perfectly acceptable)
- I used the Pico template at <https://picocss.com/>. I thought it had a good use of colors and kept the design very sleek.
  - include any modifications to the CSS framework you made via custom CSS you authored
- the five Express middleware packages you used and a short (one sentence) summary of what each one does. If you use a custom function for *one* (and one alone) middleware please
add a little more detail about what it does.

## Technical Achievements

- **Lighthouse tests**: Achieved 100% in all four lighthouse tests including, performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements

- **Site accessibility**: Used the following tips for writing, designing, and development from the W3C:

1. Using headings to convey meaning and structure: There are multiple headings used in the main page, starting with the title of the application, going down to instructions, task entry, and the lists.
2. Meaningful link text: Has a footer at the bottom of the main content page that goes to my website.
3. Provide clear instructions: Provides clear bulleted instructions at the top of the main page.
4. Keep content clear and concise: The instructions are bulleted to be short and concise (they were written as a paragraph before).
5. Sufficient contrast between foreground and background: Chose a well formatted template and updated the elements as seen necessary to provide better contrast (ex. creating a white outline around the buttons).
6. Don't use color alone to convey information: Used an asterisk in addition to color to indicate the required form fields.
7. Interactive elements are easy to identify: The website link at the bottom and the buttons are easy to identify. The style and color and used consistently for each button.
8. Form elements have clearly associated labels: The elements of the form have clearly associated labels along with colors matching the theme to show they are required.
9. Provide easily identifiable feedback: Provides colored error message for login info if incorrect. Also indicates when a field hasn't been filled out on the main page.
10. Idenify page language: Language indicated at the top of both handlebars pages.
11. Associate a label with every form control: Every input in the form has a label associated with it.
12. Reflect the reading order in the code order: The order of the elements in the code are the same in the pages.

- **Using the CRAP principles**:
1. Contrast:
2. Repetition: 
3. Alignment:
4. Proximity:
