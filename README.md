Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include:
  This was orginally gonna be a rough fake Netflix UI, with images relating to CS and WPI, that would offlink to other resources attainable to WPI students. It is currently just the super rough pages with no implementation (cause I was a little in over my head).
  I used Bulma for the CSS framework for this website, which was rough because my very orginal plan was to use Bootstrap, which I have a decent amount of knowledge in. This has been fun and I expect to build on this website, also using Bulma for the next assignment.
