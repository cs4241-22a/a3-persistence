Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include:

- The Goal of the application is to create a website using Express (node.js) and persistant data storage (mongoDB) in a simple application with multiple users
- Challenges included proper use of http requests and various other technical challenges that were overcame
- a simple non-secure login request sent to the server was implimented as it was easiest in a time crunched project and security was not a concern
- Bootstrap was used as a css template for its ease of use and modern style
- the five Express middleware packages:
  -bodyParser was available to parse the json of incoming requests
  -serveStatic was used to serve the various views and html files
  -timeout was used to ensure the program would call an error in the event of excess loading
  -morgan was used to log incoming requests
  -errorhandler was used to add development options for easier debugging

## Technical Achievements

- **100% on all Lighthouse tests**: The website was optimized under lighthouse testing to give 100% in all aspects of testing
