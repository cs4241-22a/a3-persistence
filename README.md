## TO DO App
The goal of the application was to implement a to-do list app that you can add to delete and also modify. This implementation was done both in the client and server(MONGODB)
For my CSS framework I used Bootstrap.
5 middleware packages:
app.use(express.urlencoded({extended:true}))
app.use(express.static("public"))
app.use(express.json())
app.set('trust proxy', 1)
app.use(cookie({
name: 'session',
keys:["key1","key2"]
}))
