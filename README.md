## Genshin Impact Character Tracker

Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include:

The goal of my application was to create a genshin impact team builder. Users will be able to make an account if they don't have one, and once an account is created they can log in and access their roster of characters. Users will be able to delete, add and modify existing characters in the table. 

One of my biggest challenges working on the application was connecting all the different parts. I struggled with using Glitch and used VS Code instead, but that came with its own problems. Figuring out the database was the simplest part of the homework, but I struggled a lot with figuring out the login portion and making it so that users could see their specific characters.

For the CSS framework I used Pure. I like the way it made my site look cleaner without changing the aesthetic too much. It was very simple to implement.

For Express middleware, I used body-parser.
