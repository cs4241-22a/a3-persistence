**Goals**
- Creating a two-tiered website that has the user log in or create an account to make an appointment to visit a museum

**Challenges**
- I got covid this week and I had the worst symptoms. This isn't an excuse, but this is the best I can do with
migranes and a fever lol
- I'm sad my application isn't what I wanted, I wish I had more time
- Learning Mongodb was really rough.. I've never use databases before so it took so long to understand it
- I kept switching from vsc and glitch because vsc wouldn't work when I run it since it keeps saying
the local host wasn't working. And I wanted to do the github authorization but glitch kept breaking. 
- Can I get an extra week extension (is this possible)

**Authenication**
- I wanted to implement the basic authenication using cookies, but I honestly ran out of time to actually do it.
- Literally the last minute I broke it...

**CSS framework**
- I used Blaze that helped me format my website. I just liked the way my website looked. The buttons and margins 
were pretty cool.

**Express middleware packages**
- body parser
- serve static

**Technical**
- Attempted to implement OAuth authentication using cookies.
  
**Design/UX**
