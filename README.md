QuickList is meant to be a grocery list tool where users can add, modify, or delete items from their grocery list associated with their account. 
The challenges I faced in realizing the application were mainly database-related, I was never able to fully implement delete or update functionality 
despite my code looking like pretty much every example of mongodb functions I came across. 

## Authentication Strategy
I planned to store the usernames/passwords in appdata similar to A2 then attach the username to each grocery item that got 
added to the database, but it is not functional, so currently the password for all users is "test". 
## CSS Framework
I used Bootstrap since I've used it before. I implemented the sign-in example from the Bootstrap official examples and kept the formatting consistent 
across both of my pages. I integrated the CSS of the example with the CSS I had previously used in A2, so the main custom CSS implemented is the 
flexbox formatting. 


## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I achieved 100 on all four lighthouse tests for both pages in my site.
