## The Homework Reminder

This project shows a webpage using HTML, CSS, JSON, and JavaScript (Node.js) to present a Homework Reminder
for students to markdown their assignments. I was able to design a single main page with a working form and generated
table when you hit submit. I had also conducted think-alouds with two students from WPI to test the Homework Reminder.

## Technical Achievements

- **Tech Achievement**: Using a combination of HTML, CSS, JSON, and JavaScript (Node.js)
  I created a single main page for the form which includes a generated table when submitted. The form will ask
  for your name, subject, assignment name, current date and lastly the due date. When submitted the generated table,
  will list them out in rows and with a new derived field of priority which involves calculating the amount of days left
  between the current date and the due date. If the difference in days is greater than or equal to 5, it will prompt the assignment
  as low priority, and under 5 prompt the priority to be high priority.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements

- **Design Achievement**:
- Think-Alouds:
  - Phan:
    Process: They had an easy time creating 5 new assignments with clear intentions to use all the suggested fields.
    No issues had occurred with the walk-through with the individual. They told all the steps when creating each
    submission. They typed the date rather than use the date picker.
    Suggestions: Remove the dropdown and make it sort from highest to lowest priority or sort in numerical order of
    assignments.
  - Le:
    Process: They had a quick response to creating 5 new assignments with repeating the same submission
    No issues had occurred with the walk-through with the individual. They declared all the steps when creating each
    submission, however had to remind to tell their steps.
    Suggestions: Make it sort from highest to lowest priority assignments. Also to keep the form and table uniform in size.
