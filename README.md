## Your Little Library

- My project is supposed to be a website where you can go to store information on the books you own. The user has the ability to create a personal account where all of the data of their books would be saved for future uses. Users can add new books, delete books, and also edit current books. 
- Some challenges I faced were structuring the database properly to allow users to have their own personalized libraries, and also learning the express syntax. 
- I chose to use just a simple database query of matching username and password combos because it was easiest. 
- I used Bootstrap for my CSS framework. I didn't have nay custom CSS that I authored. 
- I used "cookie-session", "express-handlebars", "connect-timeout", "response-time", and "body-parser" for my middleware. 
  - "cookie-session" stores the cookies for whatever session you're in. 
  - "express-handlebars" was used to send information from the server to the HTML.
  - "connect-timeout" times out the session after 5 seconds.
  - "response-time" records the HTTP response time.
  - "body-parser" parses the JSON. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I hosted my website using Digital Ocean instead of Glitch. This was better because it pulled my code directly from GitHub rather than me having to go in and copy the code into Glitch. 
- **Tech Achievement 2**: I got 100% on the Lighthouse tests for the three different pages of my website (screenshots included in repo).
