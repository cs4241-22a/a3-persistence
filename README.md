## TV Show Tracker
https://a3-grace-yue.glitch.me/

The goal of the application is to provide a TV show tracker web app for users to enter statistics about the shows they watch or plan to watch.

The authentication strategy used is to have the login form double as a registration form. If you try to log in with a new username (one not in the database) and any password, it will create a new account for you automatically. However, if you later try to log in with the same username and the "wrong" password, it will recognize that a user already exists in the database and expect the correct password. This strategy was chosen for simplicity.

I used the CSS framework Sakura, because it had a nice modern, simple, and centered look that I liked. I enlarged the font size from 65% to 85%; otherwise, the only changes I made were some padding on the table, tr, and td elements, as it made the results table look bad.

Express middleware packages:
1. express.json(). Converts data to JSON.
2. express.urlencoded(). Interprets urlencoded payloads (i.e. from HTML forms).
3. express.static(). Tells Express where to serve static files from.
4. cookie from cookie-session. Adds a session property to each request body for authentication purposes.
5. Morgan. Logs information about GET, POST, and PATCH requests to the console.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I got 100% on all four Lighthouse tests -- screenshot in repo.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: I followed the following tips from the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative...

1. Associate a label with every form control -- All form fields have semantic label elements to indicate their purpose.
2. Reflect the reading order in the code order -- Both HBS files are logically organized according to visual page presentation.
3. Ensure that all interactive elements are keyboard accessible -- All form fields and buttons can be accessed and activated via the Tab and Enter keys.
4. Provide informative, unique page titles -- Both pages are labeled clearly with the name of the app (TV Show Tracker) present for consistency.
5. Use headings to convey meaning and structure -- Page sections, forms, and table columns have clear labels.
6. Keep content clear and concise -- The webpages have minimal content.
7. Provide sufficient contrast between foreground and background -- The font is black on white for readability, and the buttons are clearly contrasted with the page and with the text on them.
8. Donâ€™t use color alone to convey information -- The only color-coded element is a red error message that shows up when the user tries to submit a duplicate show, and that is also bolded and of prominent font size to stand out.
9. Ensure that interactive elements are easy to identify -- All buttons are color-contrasted and logically positioned, and all form fields are clearly labeled.
10. Ensure that form elements include clearly associated labels -- All form fields are clearly labeled, both visually and semantically; see #9.
11. Provide easily identifiable feedback -- User login errors redirect to another page entirely; any attempts to submit invalid data prompt on-screen feedback in large font below the form.
12. Use headings and spacing to group related content -- The page elements are well-spaced out, and on the one page with more than one form, the form is clearly separated (by a border and extra padding) from the results table below it and the headers above it.
