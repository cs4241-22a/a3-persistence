Assignment 3 - Persistence: Two-tier Web Application with Database, Express server, and CSS template
===

## ClimbTracker

Server Link: http://204.48.19.41

I created this application to track the amount of climbs a certain climber has accomplished. Climbers can count as many
climbs as they like. Github authentication is required however. This project was very exciting for me,
but due to other classes, I was unable to commit my full attention. I chose Github authentication because it would allow
anyone in this class the easiest way to access the server. I used Bulma because it appeared to be a solid CSS framework,
and my first CSS framework I have used. (they seem awesome)

#Express Packages
passport - To manage Github authentication.
serve-favicon - To easily load the favicon.
body-parser - To make bodies easier to handle.
path - To help serve the favicon path.
express-session - To help handle the authentication session and ensure the user is logged in.


## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I used OAuth authentication via the GitHub strategy
- **Tech Achievement 2**: I hosted the site using Digital Ocean.
