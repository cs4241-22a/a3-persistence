## MINESWEEPERDLE

https://sheltered-plateau-94715.herokuapp.com/

This app is like Wordle, but for Minesweeper!

Users can login with their email and play daily Minesweeper puzzles that are generated by the server at 9am.

User information is saved as an email, a password (hashed with Bcrypt), a userId, a setting for whether or not to save game data, and a list of past games (if that setting is enabled).

I ran into a few challenges while setting up this app.

1. I couldn't get OAuth to work. For as much as I tried, I just could not get it to redirect the user to GitHub for login. I was extra frustrated by this because I've used OAuth before with Spotify several times, but I just couldn't make it happen here.
2. Heroku deployment was a challenge becuase of the port that my app was trying to run on. Heroku doesn't let you hard-code a port into your application.
3. SEO Tests: I spent a while trying to figure out how to attach a manifest to my files so that I could pass SEO Lighthouse tests
4. Content Security Policy: With Helmet middleware, my app was more secure. This meant that inline scripts didn't work as they used to. I had to go through my app and make sure that all JS was in a separate file. I also had to download jquery locally so that I could reference it.

Since I couldn't get OAuth to work, my authentication strategy was just using a basic username/password system.

My CSS framework was Bootstrap becuase I'm familiar with it. There are some custom edits that I made to elements on top of bootstrap on each page. These custom elements are used to change the color of the numbers in the Minesweeper grid, provide spacing between elements, and at times change the font.

Express middleware packages:
1. bodyParser.urlencoded: Helps parse bodies in post requests
2. bodyParser.json: extra functionality for bodyparser that deals with JSON
3. express.static: express static file serving assistance
4. cors: enables CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing), allowing a domain to be reached from another domain outside it's scope. This was going to be used for OAuth, but is now just a security feature
5. helmet: Helps secure the app by setting HTTP headers automatically

## Technical Achievements
- **Heroku Deployment**: I used Heroku do deploy my application instead of using Glitch. I ran into some trouble getting my heroku deployment to work becuase of the way I had been setting up my express server. I was hard-coding a port into the app (3000), but a Heroku deployment changes the port on startup so that it can be scaled. This meant that I had to spend a long while figuring out that I needed to add an environment variable reference to my application startup. Another trouble I ran into with Heroku was pointing my custom domain to my site. As a security feature, Heroku needs your custom domain to be registered in your app for someone to use it. Instead of saying that when you reach the page through an unregistered domain, however, it just says that it can't find the project. I tried to fix this by adding a credit card to my account, registering the domain via the CLI, and pointing my Google Domain to the DNS target that Heroku gave me (different from the standard link). This didn't end up working. I know it's possible, but I've run out of time/patience.
I found Heroku much easier to use than Glitch because I could make changes to my local code, my GitHub repository, and my Heroku repository all from the same place (VSC). I also didn't have to worry about uploading assets and changing the references.
