# Video Game Checkout System
https://a3-kpanneton.glitch.me/

The goal of my application is a system where users can check out and place holds for various video games, similar to a library but for games instead of books. This is a modified version of my library from A2, but instead of a book checkout system I changed it to video games in order to make it more unique.

Some challenges I faced in realizing the application was defintely figuring out out to both store and then manipulate the data using MongoDB.

The authentication strategy I chose to use was

For my CSS framework I used NES.css because I enjoyed the font style and the way the mouse turned into a pixeled glove pointer. It gave me nostalgic vibes and I think anyone using the website can feel that. Some modifications I made to the CSS framework were some changes so the styling of the background and text, by changing the color and size. I wanted to background to be black because I think dark mode websites are easier on the eyes, so I also modified the text to be white.

The five Express middleware packages I used were body-parser, cookie-session, connect-timeout, handlebars, and response-time.
- body-parser: Parses the JSON.
- cookie-session: Stores the cookies for the current session of the user.
- connect-timeout: Times out the server's session after a specific instance of time, in this case it is set to 5 seconds.
- handlebars: These are used to connect the HTML elements with the server.
- response-time: Records the response time for the server's HTTP request.

# Technical Achievements
- Tech Achievement 1: Instead of hosting my website on Glitch, I used DigitalOcean. This was easier because it could pull directly from my GitHub repo.
- Tech Achievement 2: I achieved 100% in all four lighthouse tests.

# Design/Evaluation Achievements
- Design Achievement 1: I followed the following tips from the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative:
1. Provide informative, unique page titles: Each page has a title that diferentiates it from the other.
2. Provide clear instructions: My website provides instructions for how to submit a hold and input information.
3. Keep content clear and concise: Only necessary information is provided on the page such as the input fields in the form, the submit button, and simple instructions.
4. Provide easily identifiable feedback: When the user leavs a field blank or puts improper inputs, they are notfied.
5. Ensure that interactive elements are easy to identify: The only interactive elements are the calender to select the date, and the submit, add, delete, modify buttons. They are all clearly labeled.
6. Provide clear and consistent navigation options: The page is pretty simple to navigate, there are minimal pages to make it easier for the user to interact with.
7. Create designs for different viewport sizes: The page adapts to different devices, creating different spacing for different devices.
8. Associate a label with every form control: Each form element on the page has a corresponding label.
9. Identify page language and language changes: The primary page language is denoted at the top of all my html files, in the header using the lang atribute.
10. Reflect the reading order in the code order: I have written my HTML code in order of what the user will be reading on the page, including CSS in a completely seperate file for increased readability.
11. Write code that adapts to the userâ€™s technology: My code adapts the size of the screen to fit on their device, such as desktop, mobile, etc.
12. Ensure that all interactive elements are keyboard accessible: All my text input fields provided in my form are keyboard accessible.
