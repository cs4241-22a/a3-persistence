## Fruit Survey - Cather Zhang

Heroku: https://fruitsurvey.herokuapp.com/

Test account:

Username: test

Password: 1234

This fruit survey application allows user to create accounts and store the responses in their account only (which are stored in MongoDB). It allows user to login once they create an account, as well as adding responses, edit and delete existing responses. 

It was very challenging to get the github login and mongodb working. Callback was hard to implement during local testing stage. I was also having trouble uploading the project to glitch for some reason.

User can use github login as well as create account to store in database. Since github id is unique with each user,  I did not need to store password in database.

CSS framework I used was bootstrap 5.1.1. It is a very popular framework and has variety of options. The only custom CSS I used was for backgrounds (e.g. picture background for header).

Middleware used:
- serve-static to display login page on default
- cookie-session, to make sure a user doesn't have to log in every time
- body-parser, to provide JSON flexibility for HTTP requests
- mongoose, to provide wrapper for accessing Mongo with a schema for survey response
- passport, for authenticating GitHub login
