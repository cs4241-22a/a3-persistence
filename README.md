Assignment 3 - Persistence: Two-tier Web Application with Database, Express server, and CSS template
===

General:  
- Your site should achieve at least 90% on the `Performance`, `Best Practices`, `Accessibility`, and `SEO` tests 
using Google [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) (don't worry about the PWA test, and don't worry about scores for mobile devices).
Test early and often so that fixing problems doesn't lead to suffering at the end of the assignment. 

Deliverables
---

Do the following to complete this assignment:

1. Implement your project with the above requirements. A good potential starting point is to use the "hello-express" project template inside of Glitch; this appears as an option when you hit the "New Project" button. Use the work you did in the last assignment as a reference to implement functionality.
2. If you developed your project locally, deploy your project to Glitch (unless completing the alternative server technical acheivement described below), and fill in the appropriate fields in your package.json file.
3. Test your project to make sure that when someone goes to your main page on Glitch, it displays correctly.
4. Ensure that your project has the proper naming scheme `a3-yourfirstname-yourlastname` so we can find it.
5. Fork this repository and modify the README to the specifications below.
6. Create and submit a Pull Request to the original repo. Name the pull request using the following template: `a3-firstname-lastname`.

Acheivements
---

Below are suggested technical and design achievements. You can use these to help boost your grade up to an A and customize the 
assignment to your personal interests, for a maximum twenty additional points and a maximum grade of a 100%. 
These are recommended acheivements, but feel free to create/implement your own... just make sure you thoroughly describe what you did in your README, 
why it was challenging, and how many points you think the achievement should be worth. 
ALL ACHIEVEMENTS MUST BE DESCRIBED IN YOUR README IN ORDER TO GET CREDIT FOR THEM.

*Technical*
- (10 points) Implement OAuth authentication, perhaps with a library like [passport.js](http://www.passportjs.org/). 
*You must either use Github authenticaion or provide a username/password to access a dummy account*. 
Course staff cannot be expected, for example, to have a personal Facebook, Google, or Twitter account to use when grading this assignment. 
Please contact the course staff if you have any questions about this. THIS IS THE HARDEST ACHEIVEMENT OFFERED IN WEBWARE. You have been warned!  
- (5 points) Instead of Glitch, host your site on a different service like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) or [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com). Make sure to describe this a bit in your README. What was better about using the service you chose as compared to Glitch? What (if anything) was worse? 
- (5 points) Get 100% (not 98%, not 99%, but 100%) in all four lighthouse tests required for this assignment.  

*Design/UX*
- (10 points) Make your site accessible using the [resources and hints available from the W3C](https://www.w3.org/WAI/), Implement/follow twelve tips from their [tips for writing](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tips/writing/), [tips for designing](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tips/designing/), and [tips for development](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tips/developing/). *Note that all twelve must require active work on your part*. 
For example, even though your page will most likely not have a captcha, you don't get this as one of your twelve tips to follow because you're effectively 
getting it "for free" without having to actively change anything about your site. 
Contact the course staff if you have any questions about what qualifies and doesn't qualify in this regard. 
List each tip that you followed and describe what you did to follow it in your site.
- (5 points) Describe how your site uses the CRAP principles in the Non-Designer's Design Book readings. 
Which element received the most emphasis (contrast) on each page? 
How did you use proximity to organize the visual information on your page? 
What design elements (colors, fonts, layouts, etc.) did you use repeatedly throughout your site? 
How did you use alignment to organize information and/or increase contrast for particular elements. 
Write a paragraph of at least 125 words *for each of four principles* (four paragraphs, 500 words in total). 

Sample Readme (delete the above when you're ready to submit, and modify the below so with your links and descriptions)
---

## TODO note

your glitch (or alternative server) link 

You can easily make your own username and password for testing, but if you want to use mine its: username:"Nick" password:"12345"

- the goal of the application was a google notes like todo tracker, users can
add todo's, check off todos (modify), and delete todos all of which are reflected in the database after the user completes the action to keep the data persistent
- The biggest challenge I faced was doing more of the processing on the server side. It would have been much more difficult to do a3 like i did a2 where the server does minimal processing and only serves the entire appdata to the webpage to be processed there. In addition to that all the new technologies introduced in this project also added to the challenge.
- To authenticate users, their inputted username is compared to the all the usernames in the database to find a match. If a match is found, the password is checked against the entered password to provide entry or not. If the username is not in the database, the user's inputed username and password become a new login in the data base. I choose this method because it seemed like the easiest way to be able to add new users
- I used Water.css because it was very easy to implement and extend for my needs and I liked its base layout and color scheme.
  - I added some id's and classes to format my pages, alter some colors, and add hover behaviors to some buttons.
- the five Express middleware packages you used and a short (one sentence) summary of what each one does. If you use a custom function for *one* (and one alone) middleware please 
add a little more detail about what it does.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I used OAuth authentication via the GitHub strategy
