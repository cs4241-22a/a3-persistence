## WPI FOOD RATING

This is a website used to rate what your favorite food choice is on campus.

I chose to have 2 pages, one page for login, and one main page for everything else.

This was a very challenging assignment overall. I had trouble getting OAuth to work, as well
as successfully connecting the mongoDB to the server.

I chose to use OAuth because a friend had used it and said that once you understood how
it worked, it wasn't actually that bad, and I needed the bonus points because I was worried
about the rest of the assignment.

I used the Bootstrap CSS framework, for no particular reason. I didn't have previous knowledge
about any CSS frameworks so I just chose bootstrap.

Express Middlewares:

express.static: Helps deliver static files

cookie-parser: Helps to access the cookies

body-parser: Helps to access body requests

passport: Helps with OAuth

connect-ensure-login: Ensures that the user is properly logged in

## Technical Achievements

- **Tech Achievement 1**:
  Implemented OAuth authentication using passport. This uses Github authentication. (10 pts)

- **Tech Achievement 2**:
  Got 100% in all four lighthouse tests required (5 pts)
