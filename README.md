Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include:

- The goal was to have a planner that was specific to each user, in which the user could add, delete, and edit items. 
- Authentication within the JavaScript
    - Password: test
- I used water.css (https://watercss.kognise.dev/)
- the five Express middleware packages you used and a short (one sentence) summary of what each one does. If you use a custom function for *one* (and one alone) middleware please 
add a little more detail about what it does.
