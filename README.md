### Acheivements
---

Encoded passwords on the database with bcrypt

Lighthouse tests for Login, Register, and Home pages returned 100% for desktop
Note: I did this without any added schedule events because the color/contrast on those is specified by the user

Which element received the most emphasis (contrast) on each page? 
  The elements that received the most emphasis were the table headers and form entry labels. The table headers received emphasis because the main information on the page came from the tables and because the headers had to stand out from the table information itself. 
  
How did you use proximity to organize the visual information on your page? 
What design elements (colors, fonts, layouts, etc.) did you use repeatedly throughout your site? 
How did you use alignment to organize information and/or increase contrast for particular elements.
